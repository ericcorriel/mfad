						<li>How to strategize your design thinking and express your ideas clearly through writing and presentations</li>

					</ul>
				<li><strong>This class is a lot of work!</strong> Have you taken motion? It's like that...maybe worse. So if you know you can't devote 10-15hrs a week to this class, or if you're taking it as a 5th class, you seriously consider dropping this class.</li>
				<li>If you are not planning on taking this class for the full year <em>please drop it</em>. There are several other students who would love to take your place.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="unstack">What this class isn't</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>We will not be designing or creating apps, interactive magazines, kiosks, or interactive installations. Websites only.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="unstack">What we'll be using</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript by doing online tutorials from <a href='http://www.codecademy.com' target='_blank' >Codecademy.com</a>
