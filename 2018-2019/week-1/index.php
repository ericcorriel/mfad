			<h3 class="unstack">Hi, I'm new here!</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>A bit about me (so I can be a resource to you)
						<li>Background: BA in Philosophy, MFA specializing in Digital Art</li>
						<li>Expertise: I am currently the Senior Digital Stragist for SVA. Previously I was the College's Lead Web Designer and Developer (PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Unix, C++)</li>
						<li>Recent art projects: <a href='http://www.ericcorriel.com/work/water-will-be-here' target='_blank' >Water Will Be Here</a>, <a href='http://www.ericcorriel.com/work/glaciers-will-not-be-there' target='_blank' >Glaciers Will Not Be There</a>, <a href='http://www.ericcorriel.com/work/targeted' target='_blank' >Targeted</a>, <a href='https://maketrumptiny.com' target='_blank' >tiny trump</a>.</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="unstack">Goals</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>introduce contemporary UX/UI prototyping tools such as <a href='http://sketchapp.com' target='_blank' >Sketch</a> and <a href='http://principleformac.com/' target='_blank'>Principle</a></li>
				<li>integrate tools into their personal projects</li>
				<li>how to prepare their projects for developers</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="unstack">Let's talk about the Internet</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>While this workshop is narrowly focused on the current UI/UX tools of the day, it will be helpful to situate those tools and the products we're building with them in a broader and richer understanding of the Internet</li>
				<li>With that said, let's dive into a pop quiz to start things off</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="unstack">Introduction to Sketch</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>In the interaction design community, designers are flocking to Sketch in droves because it provides a lot of functionality that Photoshop and other Adobe products do not
					<ul>
						<li>Symbols and nested symbols (think active and inactive icons)</li>
						<li>InDesign-esque type styles (that are even better than InDesign)</li>
						<li>Document and Global colors</li>
						<li>Tons of <a href='https://sketchapp.com/extensions/plugins/' target='_blank' >plugins</a> and many others in the open source community</li>
						<li>Built in simple prototyping</li>
						<li>Integrates well with more sophisticated prototyping software, such as <a href='http://principleformac.com/' target='_blank' >Principle</a></li>
						<li>Built to accommodate porting designs from desktop &lt;--&gt; tablet &lt;--&gt; mobile</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Deliverable: Publicly accessible Sketch Cloud URL</h4>
			<ul>

				<li>Design should include:
					<ul>
						<li>navbar that is a symbol with an "instance" for each page</li>
						<li>each page should have the navbar on it with a different
