Interaction Content Creation and Design
===
The aim of this course–taught at the School of Visual Arts in New York City–is to reinforce, with practical experience, the tools that designers need to create content for the web in some of its forms: websites, user interface design, video, motion graphics, slideshows, animation. Designers who are “content thinkers” have a greater chance at getting attention and jobs in a competitive environment. Gaining practical experience and understanding what journalists, writers, editors, producers and designers do to complete a project is valuable and critical. This course is about learning how to tell stories using the design and communication skills in which students are deeply engaged, and to take advantage of the technologies the web affords.
